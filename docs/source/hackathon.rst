Project Overview
================

Hexa Hackathon is a 2-D V2X intersection-safety simulator.

Vehicles approach a four-way intersection, exchange V2V / I2V messages
over a simulated communication bus, and a machine-learning model decides
whether each vehicle should GO or STOP.

See the :doc:`modules` page for the full API reference.
